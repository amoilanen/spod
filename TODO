Basic functionality:

- It is possible to parse a RSS feed from string
- It is possible to fetch RSS feed from a hardcoded URL
- It is possible to download the episodes from the RSS feed to a hardcoded directory

Refinement:

- Already download episodes will not be downloaded twice
- It is possible to display detailed progress information about the RSS feed processing (and file download)
- It is possible to pass both the RSS feed URL and the destination directory for storing the episodes to the running app
- It is possible to configure podcasts which should be downloaded via a configuration YAML or JSON file
- It is possible to edit the configured podcasts: add, delete, modify

- Package the app and release it
